# 🎓 Engineering Colleges Clustering Project

## 📌 Overview
Education is becoming increasingly competitive, with hundreds of institutions available for students to choose from. To aid students in making informed decisions, ranking agencies conduct surveys to assess the state of engineering education. This project collaborates with Public Relations (PR) teams to provide evidence-based insights for an editorial article in leading newspapers.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze engineering colleges using clustering techniques to categorize them into meaningful groups based on their features. Key questions to address:

- How many distinct types (clusters/segments) of colleges exist in the data?
- How do these college groups differ from each other?
- Do different clustering techniques yield varying results? How can we interpret these differences?

## 🛠️ Methodology
- **Algorithm Used:** K-Means Clustering
- **Evaluation Metric:** Silhouette Score
- **Data Processing:** Feature Scaling
- **Visualization Tool:** Silhouette Visualizer

## 📌 Why Feature Scaling is Important in Unsupervised Learning?
Feature scaling is critical in machine learning models that compute distance metrics, such as K-Means clustering. Scaling ensures that one feature does not dominate others due to differences in magnitude, allowing the algorithm to accurately identify clusters.

## 🔎 Finding the Optimal K Value
When multiple elbow points are observed in the elbow curve, we determine the optimal K by:
- Examining the silhouette score, where values closer to **1** indicate better clustering.
- Using the **Silhouette Visualizer** to assess cluster quality.

## 📊 Clustering Insights
### **Cluster 0** (Tier 2 & 3 Colleges):
- Low fees and decent infrastructure
- Lack of strong teaching quality and placement opportunities
- **Recommendations:** Focus on onboarding better faculty and securing corporate tie-ups for placements

### **Cluster 1** (Tier 1 Colleges):
- Excellent teaching, infrastructure, and placements
- High tuition fees
- **Ideal for** top corporates seeking the best candidates for recruitment

## 🔮 Conclusion
This project provides a data-driven approach to classifying engineering colleges, helping students, institutions, and recruiters make informed decisions. Further refinement of clustering techniques and feature selection can enhance the insights drawn from this analysis.
